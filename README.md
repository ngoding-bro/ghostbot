# Ghostbot - Bot Api Tokopedia

Sometimes, we see among E-Commerce traders who are carrying out excess stock on each Marketplace, this is very overwhelming for them to handle each Marketplace, this solution will help a little if implementing a very environmentally friendly helper and is very good to do anywhere and anytime. From this, I created a program for all the conveniences that E-Commerce traders can get (especially for Tokopedia), this happens because I am also an E-Commerce Tokopedia, you can see my shop here [![Tokopedia](https://img.shields.io/badge/TP-Tokopedia-green)](https://www.tokopedia.com/indraputrajaya)
## Features

- Make it easier for users to make stock changes on the Tokopedia Marketplace
- It can be used 24 hours but there will be a stage where asking for a captcha from the Shopee Marketplace because I trade first-hand on the Shopee Marketplace
- Integrated directly into Whatsapp as the Bot's main conversation with Users
- You can use this for Raspberry PI 4, because I made this feature on Raspberry PI 4


## Installation

Install the project to get the best features
```bash
  > npm i --save @open-wa/wa-automate@latest
  > npm Install
  > npm Start
```
    
## Version Of NodeJS

It is mandatory to use NodeJS between versions 12 and above and 16 and below, either on your PC or Raspberry PI 4. Besides that, there is a high probability of experiencing errors in running the program


## Optimizations

Add an additional file to the /ghostbot folder with the file name "session". This is used to store all information or account data in Chromium
